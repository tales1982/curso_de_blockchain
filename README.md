# Blockchain Course Repository

Welcome to the **Blockchain Course Repository**! This repository contains the code, notes, and resources related to my journey through learning blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps).

## 📝 Course Overview

This course covers the fundamentals of blockchain technology, including:

- Basics of blockchain and decentralized networks
- Cryptographic principles in blockchain
- Smart contract development with Solidity
- dApp creation and deployment
- Blockchain platforms and tools (e.g., Ethereum, Hardhat, Truffle)
- Security best practices in smart contracts

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Blockchain Basics**
   - What is blockchain?
   - Key components: Nodes, miners, and consensus
   - Public vs private blockchains

2. **Smart Contracts**
   - Solidity language basics
   - Writing and deploying smart contracts
   - Interaction with deployed contracts

3. **Development Tools**
   - Hardhat: A development environment for Ethereum
   - Truffle: Framework for dApp development
   - Metamask: Ethereum wallet for interacting with dApps

4. **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**
   - Frontend integration with smart contracts
   - Tools: Web3.js, Ethers.js

5. **Security and Best Practices**
